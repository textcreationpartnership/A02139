            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg> My ≈øoule, what is it thou ha≈øt done? ha≈øt thou beene ≈øtriving with the Angell, about the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of <hi>Mo≈øes?</hi> For why el≈øe ≈øhould≈øt thou bee afraid of the Angels imprecation to Sathan, when hee ≈øtrove with him about it, The Lord rebuke thee? Certainly either the Angel was very milde in his imprecation, or thou art very ≈øharp in thy deprecation. But O wretch that I am! If Sathan de≈øerved rebuking for ≈øtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with an Angel; how much more do I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve it, for ≈øtriving with the Creator of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels? and not about taking away the body of <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> but about taking away the glory of his holy Name? For ≈øuch, and ≈øo execrable are my ≈øinnes, that through them, the holine≈ø≈øe of Gods glorious name is bla≈øphemed among the Gentiles. And have I not ju≈øt cau≈øe then to feare that he will, and therefore ju≈øt cau≈øe to pray, that he will not, Rebuke me in his anger, nor cha≈øten mee in his heavy di≈øplea≈øure.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:13931:6"/>
            <p> But though rebuking were an imprecation to Sathan, yet to mee it is not ≈øo, ≈øeeing I doe not more de≈øerve it, then I need it; as I de≈øerve it for my ≈øin, ≈øo I need it for my amendment: for without rebuking, what amending? what amending indeed without thy rebuking? For alas, the fle≈øh flatters mee, the world abu≈øeth mee, Sathan deludes mee; and now O God, if thou al≈øo ≈øhould≈øt hold thy peace, and wink at my follies, whom ≈øhould I have? Alas, whom could I have, to make mee ≈øen≈øible of their foulene≈ø≈øe. If thou ≈øhould≈øt not tell mee, and tell me roundly, I went a ≈øtray, how ≈øhould I ever, alas, how could I ever be brought to returne into the right way? To thy rebuking therefore I humbly ≈øubmit my ≈øelfe; I know thou intende≈øt it for my amendment, and not for my confu≈øion; for my conver≈øion, and not for my ≈øubver≈øion: It may be bitter in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øting, but is mo≈øt comfortable in the working: hard perhaps to dige≈øt, but mo≈øt ≈øoveraigne, being dige≈øted: Yet I cannot endure thou ≈øhould≈øt rebuke mee in anger, I cannot endure it in affection, but I can le≈ø≈øe endure it in abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: It is grievous to mee, to thinke thou art angry, but it is in≈øupportable to mee, to feele thou art angry: the hand of thine anger is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, and though of thy ≈øelfe thou be as it were a ≈øweetly breathing ayre; yet anger maks thee a con≈øuming fire, that if thine anger be kindled, yea, but a little, Ble≈ø≈øed are all they that put their tru≈øt in thee.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:13931:6"/>
            <p> When I con≈øider with my ≈øelfe the many favours, unde≈øerved favours, thou ha≈øt vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øafed unto mee, and con≈øider withall, how little u≈øe, how ill u≈øe I have made of them all, though I know I have ju≈øtly de≈øerved thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking, yet my hope is ≈øtill, thou wilt adde this favour al≈øo, not to rebuke me in thine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: but when I thinke, how unkinde a thing thy rebuking is, but how terrible a thing thine anger is; when I thinke, what a paine it is to have thee cha≈øten mee, but what a death it is, to have thee cha≈øten mee in di≈øplea≈øure; then I fall a trembling in all my joynts, and never think I can make ha≈øte enough to ≈øay, and to ≈øay with ≈øighing; O Lord, rebuke mee not in thine anger, neither cha≈øten mee in thy heavie di≈øplea≈øure.</p>
            <p>But why may not God rebuke mee, as <hi>Eli</hi> rebuked his ≈øonnes? for hee rebuked his ≈øons for their ≈øinnes, and yet no anger appeared in him at all. O my ≈øoule, wilt thou make <hi>Eli</hi> a pattern for God? becau≈øe God is a loving Father, wilt thou therefore make him like <hi>Eli,</hi> too indulgent a father? <hi>Ely</hi> indeed rebuked his ≈øonnes with a rod, but hee made his rod of Ro≈øes and Violets: hee rebuked them for ≈øins of pre≈øumption, as if they had been but ≈øins of infirmity: hee rebuked them for ≈øinnes of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈ø≈øe, as if they had beene but ≈øinnes of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance: and what was this, but in≈øtead of ≈øtriking them, to ≈øtroake them, and in≈øtead of ≈øtopping them in their race, to adde rather a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13931:7"/>≈øpurre unto them? And was it not for this, that God rebuked <hi>Eli</hi> in his anger, becau≈øe <hi>Eli</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked not his ≈øonnes in his anger? I deny not O God, but that my ≈øinnes de≈øerve thine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; or rather I acknowledge they ju≈øtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke thine anger: but alas, O Lord, if thou ≈øhoulde≈øt enter into judgement with thy ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, what fle≈øh were able to ≈øtand before thee, and not bee con≈øumed? O vile ≈øinne of mine, enough to put patience it ≈øelfe into cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, able to anger a ≈øaint, nay, even the King of ≈øaints. That if thou O God, ≈øhoulde≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke mee in thine anger, if cha≈øten mee in thy heavie di≈øplea≈øure, I could not ≈øay, but that thine anger were lenitie, and thy di≈øplea≈øure, mildne≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>But what boldne≈ø≈øe of language is this in ≈øpeaking to God? am I not worthy of rebuke, for praying God, not to rebuke mee in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as though I thought that God could bee angry? For, is not anger a pa≈ø≈øion of humane infirmitie, and will I make God ≈øubject to pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions of infirmitie? Is not anger a defect in rea≈øon is? not God a perfection above rea≈øon? and can there bee defect in perfection? can there bee pa≈ø≈øion in him, that is <hi>Purus Actus?</hi> But is it not, that anger in God is not a pa≈ø≈øion, but an action, not a defect, but an effect: for then is God ≈øayd to bee angry, when he puts his judgements in execution, when his rebukings tend not to conver≈øion, but to confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion: when his mercy attempers not the rigour
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13931:7"/>of his ju≈øtice. Oh then, rebuke mee O God, but not in thine anger; rebuke me as thou did≈øt the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> who at thy rebuking repented and were converted: but rebuke mee not as thou did≈øt <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who hardned his heart at thy rebuking, and was confounded. If thou O God, ≈øhould≈øt rebuke mee in thine anger, I ≈øhould more have an eye to thy rod, then give an eare to thy le≈ø≈øon: I ≈øhould bee more terrified with thine anger, then edified with thy rebuking, and ≈øhould be made unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of thy doctrine, with the terror of thy teaching: for I, alas, am as a nayle under the workmans hammer, better driven in with gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ≈øtroakes, then with hard blowes: Oh ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, rebuke mee not O God, if thou be angry, or if thou rebuke mee, bee not angry: Two ≈øuch ≈øharp notes, as anger and rebuking are, can never make any plea≈øing mu≈øicke, if they meet together. Anger in rebuking, makes the water troubled, and thick that ≈øhould be drunk cleere, makes the Ayre ≈øultry, and hot, that ≈øhould be breathed in cold, extremely both of them unwhole≈øome for the body: and ≈øeeing thou intende≈øt my health, and ≈øeeke≈øt not to make mee ≈øicke, Let not anger enflame thy rebuking O God, that ≈øo the ayre of it I may take in the cooler, that ≈øo the water of it I may drink the cleerer. I, alas, am as a narrow mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed ve≈ø≈øell in the hand of the drawer, better filled with ≈øoftly pouring in, then with pouring in ha≈øtily, which commonly ≈øpills more then
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13931:8"/>it fills: and ≈øeeing thy rebuking is too precious a liquor to bee ≈øpilt, O poure it in with the ≈øoftly hand of patience, and not with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtie hand of anger; that ≈øo it may the ≈øooner fil, &amp; the better enter without ≈øpilling, into this narrow mouthed ve≈ø≈øell of my emptie ≈øoule. Thy rebuking O God, is to mee as thunder, but thine anger is as lightning: and is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that thou terrifie my ≈øoule with the thunder of thy rebuking, but thou wilt al≈øo ≈øet this flaxe of my fle≈øh on fire with the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thine anger? Thy rebuking of it ≈øelfe is a precious Balme, but mixt with anger, turns to a Corro≈øive: O keepe thy Corro≈øives, O God, for ≈øuch hardned hearts as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> was; Apply to mee onely the ≈øimple Balme of thy rebuking, and let it not have any mixture at all of thy Corroding anger in it. What though I have offended thee with ≈øins of anger, mu≈øt thou needs take revenge, in the ≈øame kind thou art offended? and if needs thou mu≈øt doe ≈øo, why mai≈øt thou not then take revenge of my ≈øinnes in thy good plea≈øure, ≈øeeing I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended thee as much with ≈øinnes of plea≈øure? Thou did≈øt walke in <hi>Paradi≈øe</hi> with our fir≈øt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, in the coole of the day, when the heate of the ≈øunne was over, and this made thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence as cheerfull, as glorious: Vouch≈øafe O God, to deale ≈øo with mee, rebuke mee in the coole of thy Spirit, when the heat of thine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is over-pa≈øt; for el≈øe alas, it may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but can never be comfortable.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:13931:8"/>
            <p> But if rebuking me in thine anger, be ≈øo bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Potion, what is it then, to cha≈øten mee in thine indignation? for where the wor≈øt of thy rebuking in anger, is but threatning of puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the be≈øt of thy cha≈øtening in indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, is inflicting of puni≈øhment: and though a ≈øtrong heart may perhaps endure ≈øuch threatnings, yet no ≈øtrength of heart is able to beare ≈øuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictings. It is terror enough to heare thee but chide, but to feele thee ≈øtrike, and that with ≈øtroakes of indignation, what power of any creature is able to endure it? I aske not, thou would≈øt not cha≈øten mee: this were to aske, thou would≈øt not love mee; for whom thou love≈øt, thou cha≈øtene≈øt; and would I lo≈øe thy love, for any cha≈øtening? O gracious God, cha≈øten mee in what manner, with what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure thou plea≈øe≈øt: cha≈øten mee as thou did≈øt <hi>Lazarus,</hi> by making him lye for hunger at <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves</hi> gate: cha≈øten me as thou did≈øt <hi>Iob,</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him lye with ≈øores upon the dunghill: cha≈øten mee, as thou did≈øt <hi>Daniel,</hi> by making him bee ca≈øt into the Lions denne: but then cha≈øten me in love, and not in indignation; for thy cha≈øtening in love, though it paine, yet it heales; though it brui≈øe, yet it comforts: Thy rod &amp; thy ≈øtaff, they comfort me; but thy cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtening in indignation, is paine without hope, is brui≈øing in de≈øpaire, or rather not a paine but a torment, not a brui≈øing, but a breaking: that no mi≈øery can bee comparable to this cha≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to be cha≈øtened in thine indignation.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:13931:9"/>
            <p> Cha≈øtening and love may well bee matcht together, they are like to <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Rachel,</hi> though there be ≈øeven yeares of ≈øervice more, yet <hi>Rachel</hi> will bee had at la≈øt: but cha≈øtening and indignation are as badly matcht as may bee, for cha≈øtening enclines to conver≈øion, and indignation is wholy bent upon confu≈øion; oh therefore, match thy cha≈øtening with love, and not with indignation, that ≈øo, at lea≈øt, I may come at la≈øt, to enjoy my <hi>Rachel,</hi> that is, thy favour: Cha≈øtening and love, may lodge both together in the bowels of a father, but indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation comes not where bowels are: and how then, O God, can≈øt thou cha≈øten me in indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but thou mu≈øt as it were disbowell thy ≈øelfe, and utterly abandon the name of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? and ≈øhall any thing make thee to leave that Name? I know, O God, it is a name ≈øo deare unto thee, that I hope I ≈øhall commit no ≈øuch ≈øinne; and ≈øuffer mee not O God, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any ≈øuch ≈øinne as ≈øhall ever be able to make thee abandon it. Indeed here, where wee call thee Lord, indignation may appeare, and bee bold to ≈øhew it ≈øelfe: but when wee come to name thee Father, indignation mu≈øt be gone, and never pre≈øume to come in place. If thy cha≈øtening bee intended for reforming, or for poli≈øhing, what would≈øt thou doe with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that tends to aboli≈øhing? And if thou cha≈øten whom thou love≈øt, and then de≈øtroy whom thou cha≈øtene≈øt; what difference will there bee betweene thy indignation, and thy
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:13931:9"/>mercy? Oh let not thy cha≈øtening, which is ordained to be a rod for thy children, be made a knife to ≈ølaughter thy Children: Con≈øider, O God, I am but a pot made of brittle Clay, that if thy hand hold not a temper in ≈øtriking, I ≈øhall ≈øoone bee broken, and beaten in pieces, and then thy workman≈øhip will bee defaced. And ≈øhall it ever bee ≈øayd of thee, that with one hand thou make≈øt, and with the other hand de≈øtroye≈øt? Remember O God, who≈øe title it is, to bee a de≈øtroyer: thy title is to bee a Creator: and ≈øhall I finde no more favour at the hands of a Creator, then I might looke to finde at the hands of a de≈øtroyer?</p>
            <p>Alas, my ≈øoule, I know full well, it were a grievous ca≈øe for mee, if God ≈øhould let his cha≈øtening and his indignation joyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a≈ø≈øayle mee with them both at once; but how ≈øhall I doe to keepe them a≈øunder? Have I any <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> to ≈øtand for mee in the gap? Ble≈ø≈øed be thy glorious Name, O God: I have indeed a greater then <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> even him, whom thou did≈øt cha≈øten in thy heavie di≈øplea≈øure; to the end thou might≈øt not cha≈øten mee in thy heavie di≈øplea≈øure; for his agonie of crying, My God, My God, why ha≈øt thou for≈øaken mee; gives mee boldne≈ø≈øe to cry, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in crying, My God, My God, have mercy upon mee: This I know will helpe, when all other helps ≈øayle. But what have I in my ≈øelfe to plead, why God ≈øhould not cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øten mee in his heavie di≈øplea≈øure? Can I ≈øay,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13931:10"/>I have not de≈øerved it? Or can I ≈øay I have not even provoked him to doe it? Alas, O God, I have nothing in thee to flie to, but onely thy mercy; nothing in my ≈øelfe to plead, but onely my weakne≈ø≈øe; Have mercy upon mee, O God, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ver≈øe </seg>2</label> for I am weake.</p>
            <p>But is not this a weak Plea, to alleage weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe for a Plea? weak indeed with men, who commonly tread harde≈øt upon the weake≈øt, and are ever going over where the hedge is lowe≈øt; but no weake Plea with God, who≈øe mercy is ever readie upon all occa≈øions, and then mo≈øt, when there is mo≈øt need: and ≈øeeing there is greate≈øt need, where there is greate≈øt weakne≈ø≈øe, therefore no Plea with God ≈øo ≈øtrong as this; Have mercy upon me, O God, for I am weake.</p>
            <p>But why ≈øhould <hi>David</hi> pray for mercy to helpe his weakne≈ø≈øe? for what can mercy do? Mercy can but pitty his weaknes, it is ≈øtrength that mu≈øt relieve it. But is it not, that mercy, I may ≈øay, is as the ≈øteward of Gods hou≈øe, and hath the command of all he hath: that if wi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome be wanting for direction, mercy can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it. If ju≈øtice be wanting for defence, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy can obtain it: If ≈øtrength be wanting for ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, Mercy can command it: and therefore no Plea ≈øo perfect to bee urged with God, as this, Have mercy upon mee, O God, for I am weake.</p>
            <p>But why ≈øhould <hi>David</hi> make his weakne≈ø≈øe a motive to God for mercy? for is not weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13931:10"/>an effect of ≈øinne? and can God love the effect, when hee hates the cau≈øe? but it is not the weakene≈ø≈øe in <hi>David</hi> that God loves, but the acknowledging of his weakne≈ø≈øe: for what is this, but the true humility? and who knowes not in how high account ≈øuch hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is with God, ≈øeeing it is indeed of this wonderfull condition, that though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be ≈øo low, yet nothing reacheth ≈øo high, and therefore no motive ≈øo fit to move God, as this; Have mercy upon mee, O God, for I am weake. Mercy indeed looks downe upon no object ≈øo directly, as upon weakene≈ø≈øe; and weakene≈ø≈øe lookes up to no object ≈øo directly as to mercy: and therefore they cannot chu≈øe but meete, and meeting, not chu≈øe but embrace each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Mercy, weakne≈ø≈øe as her Clyent: weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, Mercy as her Patron: that no Plea can bee with God ≈øo ≈øtrong, as this, Have mercy upon mee, O God, for I am weake. Let thy indignation, O God, be layd upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and ≈øuch as tru≈øt in their ≈øtrength, for upon them thou mai≈øt get thee honour: but alas, what honour can bee gotten, by pouring thy indignation upon ≈øo weake a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as I am? Thy honour ≈øhall bee as much to ≈øupport my weakne≈ø≈øe by thy mercy; as to abate their pride, by thine indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But what though <hi>David</hi> be weak? is every weaknes ≈øufficient cau≈øe to run to God about?
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:13931:11"/>might he not take Re≈øtoratives and Cordialls, and ≈øuch other comfortable things, and ≈øo help his weakne≈ø≈øe without going to God? O my ≈øoule, what comfort is in a Cordiall, if it be not of Gods making? what ≈øtrength in a Re≈øtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, if it be not of Gods giving? No, O Lord, thy mercy is the only re≈øtorative that can help my weakne≈ø≈øe; the true <hi>Aqua Coele≈øtis,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort my ≈øpirits.</p>
            <p>I know, O God, thou ≈øweetly di≈øpo≈øe≈øt all things both in weight and mea≈øure; Thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidere≈øt man that he is but du≈øt; Thou knowe≈øt mee, that I am a worme, and no man; and can it then be thou ≈øhould≈øt have no con≈øideration of my weakne≈ø≈øe? wilt thou not proportion thy burthen to the bearer? wilt thou loade a Gnat, as thou would≈øt loade a Camell? Oh have mercy upon mee, O God, and con≈øider my weakne≈ø≈øe, for I am weake.</p>
            <p>But why ≈øhould <hi>David</hi> make his weakne≈ø≈øe; a cau≈øe for God to ≈øpare him? for how came hee by his weakne≈ø≈øe? was it not by his owne di≈øorder? and then, if his weakne≈ø≈øe be one of his faults, hath not God ju≈øt cau≈øe to ≈øtrike him the harder for his weakne≈ø≈øe? It ≈øeemes, indeed, that <hi>David</hi> cannot deny but that he de≈øerves it, and therefore layes not his Plea in the Court of Gods ju≈øtice, but of his mercy; for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, he knoweth, hath bowells of compa≈ø≈øion, and will not alwaies bee ruled by rigour; but finding contrition, will have a regard of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe. And indeed, ≈øeeing the end of Gods
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:13931:11"/>cha≈øtening is but to piece up my breaches, why ≈øhould hee ≈øtrike ≈øo hard, to break mee in pieces.</p>
            <p>But are there not ≈øome men, that feign them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to be ≈øelves poore, when yet they be rich, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they would pay but a little tribute? And may not <hi>David</hi> be ≈øuch a one, feign him≈øelfe to bee weake, when perhaps hee was ≈øtrong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe hee would have God to ≈øpare him in his cha≈øtening? But never have ≈øuch a thought of <hi>David:</hi> for heare him what hee ≈øayes farther: Heale mee, for my bones are troubled, and ≈øurely, if his bones bee troubled, hee may well bee allowed to ≈øay hee is weake. For if there be any ≈øtrength in our bodies, it is in our bones: they are both able≈øt to with≈øtand harme, and farthe≈øt removed out of harmes way; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any trouble can come to them, it mu≈øt pa≈ø≈øe the skinne, the fle≈øh, the membranes, and all other parts, that if once the bones come to bee troubled, wee may ju≈øtly ≈øay, <hi>Res rediit ad Triarios,</hi> the matter is come to the height of extremity: And therefore, <hi>David</hi> finding trouble in his bones, had ju≈øt cau≈øe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of weakne≈ø≈øe, and to ≈øay; Heale mee, O God, for my bones are troubled. Di≈øtempers and infirmities are ever more hard, or ea≈øie to be cured, as they are ≈øeated in parts, more hard or ea≈øie to be wrought upon: and therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtempers in the ≈øpirits, are of al other the ea≈øie≈øt to be cured, more hard in the humours, but in the ≈øolid parts harde≈øt of all, for then they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13931:12"/>grow to bee Hectick; and ≈øuch, in all account, are ≈øcar≈øe held curable: and ≈øeeing of all the ≈øolid parts the bones are the mo≈øt ≈øolid, and therefore di≈øea≈øes in them the harde≈øt to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; <hi>David</hi> had ju≈øt cau≈øe to call to God for helpe, and to ≈øay; Heale mee, O God, for my bones are troubled. If the beames of a hou≈øe bee un≈øound and ≈øhaken, how is it po≈ø≈øible the hou≈øe ≈øhould ≈øtand, and as little is it po≈ø≈øible, that this body of mine ≈øhould bee ≈øaved from ruine: if my bones which are the beams of it, be out of order, and troubled.</p>
            <p>But if the trouble of the bones be ≈øo incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is it not pre≈øumption in <hi>David</hi> to ≈øay; Heale me, O God, for my bones are troubled: being as if he ≈øhould ≈øay, cure me, O God, for I am pa≈øt all cure, and ≈øo tempt God, with de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to do a worke that is impo≈ø≈øible? But is it not, that <hi>David</hi> knowes to whom hee ≈øpeakes? hee knowes hee ≈øpeaks not to <hi>Galen,</hi> or to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> hee knowes hee ≈øpeakes not to <hi>Ae≈øculapius,</hi> or to <hi>Apollo,</hi> but hee ≈øpeakes to him that is a tran≈øcendent to all the≈øe: One to whom, not only nothing is impo≈ø≈øible, but to whom all impo≈ø≈øible things are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. It were indeed an unrea≈øonable reque≈øt in the eye of Nature, but very unrea≈øonable in the eye of Faith: ≈øeeing Faith indeed is then mo≈øt rea≈øonable, when mo≈øt it is above all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon; which therefore-made <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the faithfull, becau≈øe contrary to hope, hee believed in hope, that God would
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13931:12"/>make him ≈øuch a father. And indeed mo≈øt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly then it growes to bee a cure for God, when in mans judgement it is growne incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: as Chri≈øt would not go to heale <hi>Lazarus</hi> untill hee was dead, and had beene foure daies buried, thereby perhaps to prepare beliefe for his owne re≈øurrection: ≈øeeing it might well bee believed hee could ri≈øe him≈øelfe the third day, who had rai≈øed another after foure daies. Never therefore fear, my ≈øoule, to ≈øay with <hi>David,</hi> Heale me, for my bones are troubled: for the time will come, when hee ≈øhall heale thee, not onely when thy bones bee troubled, but when they bee mouldred away into du≈øt and powder: for even then hee will gather them together againe, and make them ≈øtand up, and ≈øerve for beams to this bodie of thine, as now they doe.</p>
            <p>But how can the bones bee troubled, ≈øeeing they have no ≈øen≈øe? for it is the fle≈øh and the membranes that feele the pain, the bones feele none. Oh then con≈øider how great my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is, which ≈øtrikes a ≈øen≈øe of paine into my very parts that are not ≈øen≈øible.</p>
            <p>And now, it would bee comfort indeed to have my bones healed, if when they were hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, I might then bee at quiet; but alas, what comfort is it now to bee healed of their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when Gods cha≈øtening hand pur≈øues me ≈øtill, and layes more, and greater troubles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mee continually? for though the trouble of the bones bee the height of trouble; yet it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:13931:13"/>is but the trouble of the bodie; my ≈øoule all this while hath beene at quiet, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ver≈øe </seg>3</label> but now my ≈øoule it ≈øelfe is troubled al≈øo, and ≈øo extremly troubled, that I feele it, and feele it ≈øen≈øibly, in all the parts of my ≈øoule; I feele it in my memory, when I remember the grievous ≈øins I have committed: I feele it in my under≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when I con≈øider thy glorious Maje≈øty, whom I have offended: I feele it in my will, when I thinke upon the terrour of thy di≈øplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure which I have incurred.

            <p>But can the ≈øoule bee troubled? is it not a ≈øpirituall ≈øub≈øtance? and are not all earthly things too gro≈ø≈øe, to trouble that which is a ≈øpirit?

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:13931:13"/>finde a want there, it findes withall a trouble indeed; but a trouble to the body onely: or if to the ≈øoule, but in the bodies behalfe, which is not much: That which properly troubles the ≈øoule, is the proper trouble of the ≈øoule, and is onely in matters betweene God and us: and in matters of this nature, it lookes up to heaven, for there indeed is the ≈øoules freehold: and if that inheritance bee once que≈øtioned, then the ≈øoule findes it ≈øelfe in trouble pre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ≈øo extremely troubled: that where the trouble of the body, is but the bodie of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, this trouble of the ≈øoule is, I may ≈øay, the ≈øoule of trouble: and is not this inheritance que≈øtioned, if God fall once to rebuke mee in his anger? For ≈øeeing the inheritance is but a meere gift proceeding from his favour; how can I expect it, if I be in his di≈øplea≈øure?

My ≈øoule al≈øo is troubled: and how can it chu≈øe, ≈øeeing thou did≈øt ≈øuffer the Serpent in <hi>Paradi≈øe</hi> to di≈øturb and trouble it? But may not God then ju≈øtly reply, I took one of thy bones from thee indeed, but it was to make thee an helper: I let in the Serpent into <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈øe</hi> indeed, but it was to try thee, for thy bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perfecting; and when I ≈øaw thee ≈øo fooli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hurt thy ≈øelfe with thy helper, and ≈øo ea≈øily wonne from mee by a Tempter; had I not ju≈øt cau≈øe to leave thee to them, for whom thou lefte≈øt me? and now forlorne wretch, what ha≈øt thou to ≈øay, unle≈ø≈øe thou have leave to ≈øay; Return, O Lord, and deliver my ≈øoule, ≈øave mee for thy mercies ≈øake.</p>
            <p>But what more nece≈ø≈øity is there of Gods returning to deliver his ≈øoule, then there was before to heale his bones? and in that ca≈øe he

Is it not, that many di≈øea≈øes may be well enough cured, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by relation of ≈øymptomes, though the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitian come not where the patient is: and of this ≈øort it ≈øeemes was the healing of his bones: but to deliver his ≈øoule, is of another nature, and requires perhaps a feeling the pul≈øe, perhaps, an in≈øpection of the patient: and therefore no remedie, here but the Phy≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mu≈øt him≈øelfe bee pre≈øent.</p>
            <p>But is it enough to make ≈øuite to God in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall terms, to pray him to deliver my ≈øoule, and not tell from what it is, hee mu≈øt deliver it? Can any man thinke that God will returne up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ≈øo uncertaine an occa≈øion? Alas, O Lord, it is not unknown to thee, that my ≈øoule wants no clothes: and therefore, it is not to deliver it from nakedne≈ø≈øe: my ≈øoule needs no meat, and therefore it is not to deliver it from hunger: my ≈øoule is never old, and therefore it is not to deliver it from the wrackes of time; but it is indeed to deliver it from trouble: and what it is that can trouble my ≈øoule, thou knowe≈øt: for my ≈øoule is thy ≈øervant, depending wholy upon thy favour, and having offended thee, de≈øires to bee delivered from all feare of thine anger: My ≈øoule was at fir≈øt a free ≈øpirit, but is now become a bond≈ølave to ≈øinne, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore de≈øires to bee delivered from this bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: My ≈øoule is it ≈øelfe immortall, but is troubled here with a mortall body, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13931:17"/>de≈øires to bee delivered from this bodie of death: and in effect it is all but ≈øinne, and the traine that ≈øinne drawes after it, from which I de≈øire my ≈øoule ≈øhould bee delivered. And therefore returne, O Lord, and deliver my ≈øoule, ≈øave mee for thy mercies ≈øake.</p>
            <p>But O my ≈øoule, with what rea≈øon can≈øt thou expect that God ≈øhould ever returne to thee? for who would bee willing to come to one in trouble, as thou art, le≈øt hee pay for his comming, with drawing a trouble upon him≈øelfe? and if hee ≈øhould returne and come unto thee, would≈øt thou bee ≈øo ≈øatisfied? would≈øt thou not pre≈øently bee importuning him for further favours? Hee mu≈øt helpe thee in thy troubles; He mu≈øt helpe thee out of thy troubles, or thou would≈øt never bee at quiet. And is it a ≈ømall matter to deliver a ≈øoule out of trouble? Do ≈øoules u≈øe to bee troubled for trifles? and were he not better then to endure thy importunity for his returning, then being returned, to bee troubled with importunitie for thy deliverance? But O my ≈øoule, be not frighted with the≈øe vaine objections: for, is God like man, that hee ≈øhould bee afraid of being troubled? Is he not the God of mercy; and can it bee a trouble to his mercie, to doe the workes of mercie? Is it not his delight to bee; Is it not his title to bee called; Is not his glory to bee counted a deliverer? and is any deliverance ≈øo fit for his mercie, ≈øo worthy of his mercie, as deliverance of ≈øoules? Alas,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:13931:17"/>O Lord, it is a ≈ømall worke for thee to return; but thou ≈øhalt doe an infinite worke by thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning: for thou ≈øhalt deliver my ≈øoule out of trouble, my grieved ≈øoule out of grievous troubles; and wilt thou not afford me ≈øo much kindne≈ø≈øe, to doe ≈øo ≈ømall a matter, for effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ≈øo great a matter? Oh returne, O God, and deliver my ≈øoule, that as thou art called a deliverer, ≈øo I may call thee my deliverer, and may ≈øing with <hi>Mo≈øes:</hi> Thou, O God, art my ≈øtrength, and my ≈øong, for thou ha≈øt been my deliverance.</p>
            <p>But why ≈øhould this be made ≈øo great a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? For though in ≈øaying, returne, O Lord, and deliver my ≈øoule: I ≈øeeme to require of God, two ≈øeverall workes: one to return, and another to deliver mee; yet they are in truth but both as one: at lea≈øt, no more differing then the cau≈øe and the effect; ≈øeeing his very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning is it ≈øelfe a deliverance. The onely tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his face towards mee, makes mee to ≈øee the light of his countenance; and no ≈øooner doth that light ≈øhine upon my ≈øoule, but all the clouds that darkened it, are pre≈øently di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled: all the troubles that vexed my bones, are in≈øtantly healed. But though deliverance bee an effect of Gods returning, yet it mu≈øt bee when hee returnes in a good moode, and not in a rebuking, or in a cha≈øtening di≈øpo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for if his anger continue ≈øtill, were it not better for mee, hee ≈øhould tarry away? and why then am I ≈øo importunate with him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:13931:18"/>before I know in what termes I ≈øtand with him; and whether hee bee angry ≈øtill, or no? but it is even for this that I importune his returning, that I may bee a≈ø≈øured his anger is pa≈øt; for as long as hee is angry, hee never comes where I am; to doe that, were a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter favour then his anger can afford; but as ≈øoone as his anger is a little over, hee is apt of him≈øelfe to returne unto mee; for his delight is with the children of men, and ≈øpecially with tho≈øe that call upon him: and when he returns, his anger being over, hee u≈øeth to doe as the Dove did, that when the waters were a little abated, returned into the Arke, and brought the Olive branch with her in her mouth: ≈øo God returning, when the waters of his di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øure are a little abated, brings the Olive branch of peace, and deliverance along with him.</p>
            <p>But ≈øay my ≈øoule that God ≈øhould returne, and ≈øhould deliver thee; would≈øt thou then be quiet, and not trouble him with any more ≈øuits? ≈øhould this bee the la≈øt reque≈øt thou would≈øt make? Alas no, I have one ≈øuit more to make; and Thou O God, that gave≈øt <hi>Abraham</hi> leave to importune thee with one ≈øuite after another, vouch≈øafe mee this favour, to make this ≈øuite al≈øo, and this indeed ≈øhall bee the la≈øt I will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make: Save mee for thy mercies ≈øake. For as thy returning would bee to ≈ømall purpo≈øe if thou did≈øt not deliver me: ≈øo thy deliverance will bee to ≈ømall purpo≈øe, if thou doe not al≈øo
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:13931:18"/>≈øave me. To deliver mee, and then leave me to bee ≈øeized upon againe, would make thee but <hi>Author imperfecti operis;</hi> leave thy worke im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, which cannot agree with the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy mo≈øt perfect workman≈øhip. And now, O God, if thou take plea≈øure in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, be plea≈øed to take plea≈øure in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, not to joyne thy rebuking and thy anger together: not to joyne thy cha≈øtening and thy indignation together, but to joyne thy deliverance and ≈øalvation together: for tho≈øe conjunctions ≈øeperate us from thee, this conjunction unites us to thee: tho≈øe bring us to ≈øhipracke, this brings us into the Haven: Deliverance avoids the rocks, ≈øalvation ≈øets ≈øafe on ≈øhore. And is not this that which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> meanes, when in another place hee ≈øaith, With thee, O God, there is plenteous redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption? It is redemption indeed, if thou but onely deliver my ≈øoule: but it is not plenteous redemption, unle≈ø≈øe be≈øides delivering, thou al≈øo ≈øave mee. O then bee plea≈øed in thy plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous redemption, to grant mee this conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of deliverance and ≈øalvation, that I may returne thee the conjunction of prai≈øe and thank≈øgiving; and may ≈øing and ≈øay, O Lord, I will prai≈øe thee: though thou wa≈øt angry with mee, yet thine anger is turned away. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, God is my ≈øalvation, I will cru≈øt, and not bee afraid.</p>
            <p>But how can God returne to deliver mee, and to ≈øave mee: if hee returne not a deliverer
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:13931:19"/>and a ≈øaviour? and when will this bee? O my ≈øoule, in how much better ≈øtate art thou, then <hi>David</hi> was? for hee onely expected when it ≈øhould bee, but thou art a≈ø≈øured when it was. For then was God manife≈øted to returne a deliverer, and a Saviour, when the Angell brought this tidings to the ≈øhepherds; This day is borne to you a Saviour, of whom al≈øo a voice from heaven te≈øtified; This is my wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved Sonne, in whom I am well plea≈øed. Oh then return to me, in this Saviour, in whom, thou art well plea≈øed: that ≈øo I may bee ≈øure, for ≈øo I ≈øhall bee ≈øure thou wilt not cha≈øten me in thy di≈øplea≈øure.</p>
            <p>As there have beene many particular Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and flouds, yet but one generall: ≈øo there have beene many particular deliverers and ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours, yet but one generall: and from this generall Saviour it is that I de≈øire &amp; expect ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: for though his being a generall Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, may make him bee thought le≈ø≈øe carefull of mee, having ≈øo many others to care for be≈øides: yet have no feare of that, my ≈øoule, ≈øeeing hee is as much a Saviour to mee, as if he were a Saviour to none but mee; and this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Saviour will ≈øave mee generally, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from temporall, but from ≈øpirituall enemies: Not onely from trouble of bones, but from trouble of ≈øoule: Not onely from mi≈øeries here on earth, but even from mi≈øeries, when earth it ≈øelfe ≈øhall bee no more. O happy ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, when this Saviour ≈øhall come and ≈øave
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:13931:19"/>mee: but how may I doe to get him to come? for hee comes not but upon ≈øome motive. If I had all the gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> I would willingly give it all, to get him to come and ≈øave mee: but, alas, I neither have it to give, nor doth he care to have it: if any thing winne him to doe it, it mu≈øt bee for his mercies ≈øake, and for his mercies ≈øake hee will doe it, if ever hee will doe it.</p>
            <p>But is not this ≈øtrange? My weakne≈ø≈øe was the motive before to move God to mercy; and mu≈øt his mercie now be it ≈øelfe the motive to move him to ≈øave mee? yet ≈øo it is: For when Gods mercie findes no motive from us; rather then fayle of moving, it becomes a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to it ≈øelfe: and happy it is from us, that ≈øo it is: for el≈øe we might often be without it, when mo≈øt wee need it: or rather alwaies bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, ≈øeeing wee alwaies need it. Indeed this motive, For his mercies ≈øake, is the <hi>Primum mobile</hi> of all motives to God, for ≈øhewing his favour. Hee had never delivered the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but for his mercies ≈øake: Hee had never ≈øaved <hi>Noah</hi> in the Arke, but for his mercies ≈øake: but above all, Hee had never ≈øent his Sonne to ≈øave the world, but for his mercies ≈øake: And how then can I doubt, and not rather be confident, that for his mercies ≈øake hee will al≈øo deliver my ≈øoule, and ≈øave mee. Never therefore my ≈øoule looke after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further motives: for upon this motive will I ≈øet up my re≈øt: His mercie ≈øhall be both my

            <p>And now, O God, thou ≈øee≈øt the manifold troubles I am in, thou ≈øee≈øt how weake I am; thou ≈øee≈øt how my bones are troubled; thou ≈øee≈øt how my ≈øoule is troubled; and what now can thy cha≈øtening hand have more of me, but onely to take away my life? and even my life I would willingly make a ≈øacrifice to appea≈øe thy di≈øplea≈øure. <label type="milestone">

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:13931:21"/>the dividing of the bodie from the ≈øoule, is a kinde of death to the ≈øouler that it is not, as it would bee, nor fully enjoyes it ≈øelfe, untill it can meete with the bodie, and bee united to it againe: For though it find the bodie here but a ba≈øe cottage, or rather a loath≈øome pri≈øon, yet it ≈øhall finde it there a glorious Palace, or rather a holy Temple con≈øecrated to God: and therefore untill this bee had, it will not fully be accompli≈øhed that is here prayed for: Returne, O God, and deliver my ≈øoule, ≈øave mee, for thy mercies ≈øake.</p>
            <p>The remembrance of this, that I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memember thee in death, makes mee forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of my ≈øelfe in life: and becau≈øe I cannot prai≈øe thee, nor pray to thee in the grave, it makes me to ≈øigh and weepe to thee in my bed: and what I want in continuance, to ≈øupply with violence. <label type="milestone">

               <hi>For I am weary with my ≈øigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: all the night make I my bed to ≈øwimme, I water my cowch with my teares.</hi> Oh let my remembring thee in life, ≈øupply the place of my forgetting thee in death: and when I lye in my grave ≈øen≈øle≈ø≈øe and ≈øilent, bee plea≈øed to remember how I have lyen in my bed ≈øighing and weeping. My ≈øinnes, as being di≈øordinate pa≈ø≈øions, make me undergo a pa≈ø≈øive pennance: and this hath beene my weakne≈ø≈øe, my trouble of bones, and my trouble of ≈øoule: but being al≈øo di≈øordinate actions, they make mee liable al≈øo to doe active pennance: and what is this, but my ≈øighing, and my weeping? and though
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:13931:22"/>I cannot act ≈øorrow, ≈øo well as ≈øinne, yet my bed and my couch can be witne≈ø≈øes of my ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as well as of my ≈øinne. Mine eyes indeed chiefly have done the pennance, becau≈øe mine eyes fir≈øt began the offence: if mine eyes had not ≈øet mee fir≈øt on fire, mine eyes had not ≈øhed ≈øuch ≈øhowers of teares: but now, how could burning bee quenched but with water? how burning ri≈øing from mine eyes; but with water falling from mine eyes? But yet why ≈øhould my bed ≈øuffer? for my bed had no hand in the fault of mine eyes? but alas, how could my bed but prove a <hi>Deodand;</hi> which ≈øo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, I may ≈øay, did <hi>Movere ad mortem?</hi> Though my bed were not principall in the act, yet my bed was acce≈ø≈øary to the fact, as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unlawfull and ≈øtollen plea≈øures.</p>
            <p>But though my ≈øinnes indeed bee my grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt enemies, yet there are per≈øonall enemies that have their malignity al≈øo, which though I cannot ≈øay they trouble mee as ill, yet I may truely ≈øay, they trouble mee as well as the≈øe: for mine eye is con≈øumed becau≈øe of griefe, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ver≈øe </seg>7</label> and is waxen old, becau≈øe of all mine enemies. You may ≈øay perhaps that my ≈øighes were feigned, and that my teares were counterfeit: but the con≈øumption of mine eye, is a witne≈ø≈øe of my ≈øorrow, without exception; that if my pa≈ø≈øive pennance before, were not cau≈øe ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: at lea≈øt, my active pennance now gives mee ju≈øt cau≈øe to ≈øay, Was ever ≈øorrow like my ≈øorrow? was ever griefe like this of mine?

            <p>But what meanes <hi>David</hi> by this? will not his weeping make his enemies rejoyce the more? will not the ≈øeeing him thus dejected, make them the more in≈øulting over him? will they not bee readie to ≈øay, Is this hee that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered a Lion, and a Beare? Hee that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred combate with a Giant, the terrour of a whole Armie; and now to fall a crying one cannot tell for what? But <hi>David</hi> is a better husband of his teares then to ≈øpend them idly, hee knowes for what hee ≈øpends them, becau≈øe of his enemies indeed, but not for feare of his enemies: They are neither teares of feare; for whom ≈øhould hee feare, that hath God on his ≈øide? Nor teares of vaine glory; for why then ≈øhould hee ≈øhed them in the night, when none can ≈øee them: Nor teares of joy; for how then ≈øhould they make him looke old, which is an effect of griefe: but they are tears of ≈øupplication, and teares of compa≈ø≈øion. Fir≈øt of ≈øupplication; that God will either convert them, or confound them: and not converting,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13931:23"/>then teares of compa≈ø≈øion, to thinke of their confu≈øion. For ≈øuch is the tenderne≈ø≈øe of a godly eye, that it hath teares to ≈øhed even for enemies: And when the≈øe two waters, the teares of ≈øupplication, and the teares of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øion meet together, what mervaile if they make a floud in <hi>Davids</hi> bed, ≈øeeing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe of like waters made the great Deluge in the whole world? for what are his teares of ≈øupplication, but as the waters that ro≈øe from the ≈øprings of the earth? and what are his teares of compa≈ø≈øion, but as the waters that fell from the Cataracts of heaven? Or is it not perhaps that <hi>David</hi> makes his enemies here, a figure of his ≈øinnes, which are indeed his greate≈øt enemies? as al≈øo that hee makes his owne pa≈ø≈øion, a figure of Chri≈øts compa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, which was indeed one of his pa≈ø≈øions? for then hee wept over <hi>Ieru≈øalem</hi> in compa≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their confu≈øion, when with teares of ≈øupplication hee could not prevaile with them, in compa≈ø≈øing their conver≈øion: when they would not heare him how often hee would have gathered them together as a Hen gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth her Chickens, with teares of ≈øupplication, Then they heare him ≈øay, There ≈øhall not a ≈øtone be left upon another, which ≈øhall not be ca≈øt down, with teares of compa≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <p>I grieve not ≈øo much that mine eye is waxen old, though it bee waxen old with griefe, as I grieve to ≈øee that my enemies have no eyes at all, at lea≈øt, no eyes but of malice, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce

I grieve to ≈øee their de≈øtruction draw neere, and they laugh at my grieving, and at the oldne≈ø≈øe, and alteration which griefe hath brought upon mee. And was it not ≈øo with my Saviour Chri≈øt, which made the <hi>Iewes</hi> ≈øay; thou art not yet fifty yeares old, as though he looked like one neere fifty, when hee was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed not much above thirty:</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ver≈øe </seg>9</label> Hee hath heard my reque≈øt. But what? hath God no Ma≈øters of Reque≈øt about him, but is Ma≈øter of Reque≈øts him≈øelfe?

            <p>If hee onely heard the voice of my teares; I might doubt le≈øt he thought them but like the teares of <hi>E≈øau,</hi> and ≈øo ≈øhould ≈ølight them: Or if hee onely heard my reque≈øt, I might feare le≈øt he thought it but like the reque≈øt of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Zebedees</hi> ≈øonnes, and ≈øo reject it: but now that hee hath taken my ≈øupplication into his hands, now I may bee ≈øure hee meanes to doe ≈øomething in it: ≈øeeing hee never takes

The voice of my tears brought God to ca≈øt his eye upon mee: My reque≈øt brought him to bow his eare unto mee: but the taking my ≈øupplication into his hand, hath brought him to compa≈ø≈øionate my e≈øtate: and ≈øeeing his compa≈ø≈øion is active, and his pitty relieving; my teares of ≈øorrow may now bee turned into teares of joy, my lamentations into ≈øongs of thanks giving. The lamentable accent of my language, made God fir≈øt to looke upon mee: The pittifull nature of my ≈øuite, made him next to li≈øten to mee: but the ju≈øtne≈ø≈øe of my cau≈øe in hand, made him la≈øtly, to take my pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into his hand, which is in effect to grant it out of hand.</p>
            <p>Indeed God is with no mu≈øicke ≈øo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, as with that of voyces; with no voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ≈øo much, as with tho≈øe of teares; with no teares ≈øo much, as with tho≈øe of the heart, and ≈øuch were mine, though ≈øent forth by the eies: And now, who≈øe eyes would not be moved at ≈øo ≈øtrange a ≈øight, to heare eyes ≈øpeak? who≈øe eares would not be moved at ≈øo ≈øtrange a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, to ≈øee tears bee a ≈øutour? who≈øe hands would refu≈øe ≈øo ≈øtrange a writing, where eies, I may ≈øay, are the Penne, teares the Inke, and ≈øighes the paper? Pardon my curio≈øity O God, in imagining wonders, while I meditate of thee, in whom are nothing but wonders.</p>
            <p>And what remaines now, but that my ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:13931:25"/>remove their lodging, and ≈øojourn with my enemies, as they have done with me: what remaines, but that my ≈øighes bee turned upon mine enemies brea≈øts, my teares upon their eyes, and that the pit they digged for me, they may fall into them≈øelves; and that, with the violence of falling ≈øuddenly. As for me, I ≈øhall live to ≈øee mine enemies turne their backs and be a≈øhamed: I ≈øhall live to ≈øee them hide their faces, and be confounded: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all, and above all, I ≈øhall live to magnifie thy glorious Name, O God, who art ble≈ø≈øed for ever.</p>

            <head>MEDITATIONS and Di≈øqui≈øitions upon the 32. P≈øalme.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Le≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe was cried in the fir≈øt P≈øalme, but was there held ≈øo deare, that few or none have ever been able to go to the price. Now in this P≈øalme it is cried againe, and at a low rate; and if it bee not taken now, it is not like hereafter to bee ever had ≈øo cheape again. For, where before it mu≈øt have co≈øt an ab≈øolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining from ≈øin, and a perfect delighting in the Law of God, with a continuall exerci≈øing in it day and night; Now if wee can but get our iniquities to bee remitted, and our ≈øinnes to bee covered, it will ≈øerve the turne, and bee accepted.</p>
            <p>But is this ≈øo much an ea≈øier rate? For though the purcha≈øing of Ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe, were before a great worke to bee done, yet it was a worke that might bee done by our ≈øelves: where the purcha≈øing it this way, mu≈øt be the worke of another: and were it not better to have it by a way in our owne power, then by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:13931:27"/>a way in anothers will? But O my ≈øoule, Is it in man to direct his own way? Is it in mans power, to performe the worke that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? hath hee not long ≈øince put out the light that ≈øhould have guided him in it? hath hee not long ago cut off the lock, that ≈øhould have beene his ≈øtrength to performe it? Oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ble≈ø≈øed bee hee that affords us ble≈ø≈øednes at this rate: For though it bee in anothers will to grant it, yet con≈øider who≈øe will it is; even his that is more readie to forgive, then we are readie to aske forgivene≈ø≈øe, and is rather a ≈øui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour to us to take a pardon, then ≈øtayes for us to bee ≈øuitours to have a pardon.</p>
            <p>But may it not bee thought, becau≈øe ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øedne≈ø≈øe is ≈øet here at a lower rate, that it is not ≈øo good a ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe as the other? and then what is gotten by the bargaine? a lower price indeed, but meaner ware. But this cannot bee, for ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe admits no degrees of compari≈øon; as ble≈ø≈øed they, that have their ≈øinnes forgiven, as they (if any ≈øuch were) that have no ≈øins to forgive. For though ble≈ø≈øednes be a po≈øitive thing, yet it is a ≈øuperlative thing: and if there want any thing of being a ≈øuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, there mu≈øt needs want ≈øomething of being a ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe. Ble≈ø≈øed then are they that have their ≈øins forgiven: for to bee forgiven, is as much as never to have beene guilty: and to ≈øay, Ble≈ø≈øed are they who≈øe iniquities are forgiven; is all one as to ≈øay, Ble≈ø≈øed are they that never ≈øinned. When our ≈øinnes are once
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:13931:27"/>forgiven, wee are then at peace with God with whom, untill they were forgiven, wee were at enmity: and if no mi≈øery bee compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to this, to have Gods di≈øplea≈øure; then no ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe can be comparable to this, to have his favour: and his favour we ≈øhall be ≈øure to have, if he forgive us our ≈øins; and therefore, Ble≈ø≈øed are they who≈øe iniquities are forgiven.</p>
            <p>But is all the way as ≈ømooth as this? Is there not a rubbe in the way here? for to ≈øay, Ble≈ø≈øed are they who≈øe iniquities are forgiven, is very plau≈øible; but to ≈øay, Ble≈ø≈øed are they who≈øe ≈øinnes are covered, ≈øeemes to marre all. For what if my ≈øinnes bee ≈øo great that they cannot bee covered? mu≈øt I therefore be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to lo≈øe my ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe? It is true indeed, though my ≈øinnes bee in number as the ≈øands of the Sea, yet the Sea is great enough to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them all: But alas, the ≈øea covers not ≈øins, though it cover the ≈øinners; and what ble≈ø≈øed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe can there bee in ≈øuch a covering? If I goe to the world to cover them, and indeed the world is wide, and no doubt a great cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of ≈øinnes: but alas, the worlds covering is but Hypocri≈øie; and what were this, but to cover one ≈øinne with another, a le≈ø≈øer with a greater, and ≈øo I ≈øhould bee covering them ≈øtill, and never cover them, but lay them more open in the ≈øight of God, then they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. If I goe to the Heavens to cover them; and indeed the heavens are large, <hi>Et tegit om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia Coelum:</hi> but alas, the Heavens are full of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:13931:28"/>lights, and will ≈øooner di≈øcover that which is hidden, then cover any thing that lies open to view. Yet I may hope to get the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims to cover them, for they have broad wings, and of a wonderfull extent: but alas, the Cherubims have u≈øe enough of their wings to cover their owne faces: they cannot with all their wings ≈øo much as cover the lea≈øt of all my ≈øinnes. And what hope then to have my ≈øinnes covered, when neither the Sea, nor the World, neither the Heavens, nor the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims that are above the Heavens, be able to cover them. Yet they mu≈øt bee covered, or there can bee no ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe. And how am I then in any better ca≈øe for attaining of ble≈ø≈øed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, then I was before? Two waies propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for attaining it, and both impo≈ø≈øible: There, the price not po≈ø≈øible to bee payd: Here, the bargaine not po≈ø≈øible to bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. But O Thou that ≈øitte≈øt in the Heavens, O Thou that ride≈øt beteewn the Cherubims, Ble≈ø≈øed bee thy glorious Name: For thou came≈øt thy ≈øelfe from Heaven of purpo≈øe to cover them; Thou broughte≈øt that with thee from Heaven, which onely is able to cover them: for what can cover ≈øinnes but righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈ø≈øe? what cover infinite ≈øinnes, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe? and where is any infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe to bee found, but in him onely that is infinitene≈ø≈øe it ≈øelfe?

            <p>There are ≈øome perhaps will grant, that ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe may con≈øi≈øt in covering indeed, but not in covering of ≈øinnes: They thinke rather in covering their Tables with rich plate, and dainty di≈øhes: or in covering their hou≈øes with ≈ølates of Gold; like <hi>Aurea domus Neronis;</hi> or in covering their backes with ≈øilke and ≈øoft raiment, ≈øuch as Chri≈øt ≈øaith are in Kings hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes: but <hi>Nabuchodonozor</hi> will come in for one, <hi>Dives</hi> for another, and <hi>Haman</hi> for a third, and give cleer evidence that all the≈øe are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and that <hi>David</hi> onely tells us the truth; They, they onely are the ble≈ø≈øed men who≈øe ≈øinnes are covered.</p>
            <p>But what needs all this ≈øca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ning and di≈øcu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing? For, what more my≈øterie is there in ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Ble≈ø≈øed are they who≈øe iniquities are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and who≈øe ≈øinnes are covered; then if it were ≈øaid, Ble≈ø≈øed are they, from who≈øe ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities thou turne≈øt away thy face, and who≈øe offences thou blotte≈øt out? Or, (becau≈øe the Scripture hath plenty of expre≈ø≈øings in this kinde) then if it were ≈øayd; Ble≈ø≈øed are they who≈øe iniquities thou ca≈øte≈øt behind thy back, and who≈øe ≈øinnes thou remove≈øt from thee as farre as the Ea≈øt is from the We≈øt? for to what tends this variety of expre≈ø≈øing, but either for illu≈øtration: or at mo≈øt, for vehemencie of a≈ø≈øeveration, that our ≈øinnes are pardoned?
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:13931:29"/>But if it be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ceived to be not ≈øo much a divers expre≈ø≈øing of the ≈øame way, as an expre≈ø≈øing of a divers way to ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe; then indeed, as being more my≈øticall, it will bee more mi≈øty for di≈øcerning cleerly what the meaning of <hi>David</hi> is. Is it then, that forgiving our ≈øinnes is the worke of Gods mercie; for it is mercies worke onely to forgive; covering our ≈øinnes, the worke of his love; for love covers the multitude of ≈øinnes: not imputing our ≈øinnes, the worke of his will; as hee ≈øaith, I will have mercie, on whom I will have mercie: that ≈øo wee may have here a three fold cord of Gods goodne≈ø≈øe to relye upon for our ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe? Or is it, that remi≈ø≈øion is nece≈ø≈øary for ≈øins of commi≈ø≈øion, Covering, nece≈ø≈øary for ≈øins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion; but not imputing may ≈øerve for ≈øins of tran≈ømi≈ø≈øion; that is, for ≈øin originall, tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us from our fir≈øt Parents? Or is it that forgiving is mentioned as the worke of God the Father, who≈øe worke properly it is to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give: as hee ≈øaith, I am he that blot out tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øions: Covering is mentioned as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per work of God the Son; as with who≈øe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈ø≈øe our ≈øins are covered: and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith, Put yee on the Lord Chri≈øt Ie≈øus: Not imputing is mentioned as the work of the holy Gho≈øt; who being all love, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øionates our infirmities, and ≈øo all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons in the Deitie have a hand, (as it is fit they ≈øhould) in this great worke of procuring to us our ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe: that as at the making of

            </p>
            <p>As long as iniquities are unforgiven, the con≈øcience lies as it were on a Racke tortured and tormented, day and night; but as ≈øoone as there comes a pardon, it is pre≈øently taken off the Racke, and layd at ea≈øe: and is not this a ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe? As long as our ≈øinnes remaine uncovered, God turnes away his face, and frownes upon us; but as ≈øoone as our ≈øinnes bee covered, hee ≈øhewes us againe the light of his countenance: and is not this a ble≈ø≈øed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe? As long as our ≈øinnes are imputed to us, wee are in the ≈øtate of <hi>Adam</hi> when hee was ca≈øt out of Paradi≈øe: but as ≈øoone as wee are freed from this imputation, we pre≈øently heare Chri≈øt ≈øay; This day thou ≈øhalt bee with mee in Paradi≈øe: and is not this again a ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe? And is it not now, that <hi>David</hi> expre≈ø≈øeth it three waies, to ≈øhew, that by it a godly man is not onely ble≈ø≈øed, but thrice ble≈ø≈øed?</p>
            <p>But ≈øeeing forgiving, and covering, and not imputing of ≈øinnes, are all but privative things; how can they make a ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe, which is a po≈øitive thing? They may take away mi≈øery, but can never make a ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe. But is not the very taking away of mi≈øery, in this ca≈øe, a ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe? for ≈øeeing we were ordained by God at fir≈øt, to a ble≈ø≈øed e≈øtate, and nothing barres us from that e≈øtate, but ≈øinne; are wee not by the removing this barre, either left in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:13931:30"/>this e≈øtate, or at lea≈øt re≈øtored to it againe? O gracious God, grant mee the forgivene≈ø≈øe of mine iniquities, and the covering of my ≈øins, and let mee never come at Heaven, if I make not of the≈øe privatives, a <hi>Iacobs</hi> Ladder to climbe up to Heaven.

            <p>It ≈øeemes this is a doctrine, in favour plainly of plaine dealing: but is this a world for plain dealing to thrive in? and if no thriving, what ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe?

If thou can≈øt not, then can≈øt thou not repent when thou plea≈øe≈øt; for a true repentance, is never without a burning ardour of Gods Spirit.</p>
            <p>But is there indeed any time when God may not be found? Is he like to ≈øome Princes, who ≈øhut them≈øelves up in ≈øtate at times, and are not then to bee ≈øpoken withall, or ≈øeene? O great God, thou art not like man, and therefore not found after their manner: found, when onely their per≈øons are found: but to finde thee, is to find thee gracious, without which, as good lo≈øt thou wert, as found: and gracious can none finde thee, but onely the penitent: and therefore for this, ≈øhall every one that is godly pray unto thee, ≈øo that through the grace of a true repentance, hee may finde thee gracious.</p>
            <p>When a ≈øinne is committed, a ≈øhower of Gods anger raines pre≈øently downe upon the ≈øinner; and continues raining, till there be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: and if the repentance bee deferred long, it may raine downe anger ≈øo long, till it make a floud, and then there will bee no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neere to God for water: but rather the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will goe neere to bee a cau≈øe of drowning:
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:13931:35"/>for it is not every ones cafe to have an Arke to ≈øave him≈øelfe in from the floud of Gods anger; hee onely may bee confident to bee ≈øaved, that like <hi>Noah,</hi> begins to make his Arke betimes, and returns to God with a ≈øpeedy repentance.</p>
            <p>But why is it ≈øayd, every one that is godly, and not rather, every one that is wi≈øe? ≈øeeing it is wi≈øedome, and not godline≈ø≈øe, that can di≈øcerne the fitne≈ø≈øe of times and ≈øea≈øons?

Before I repented, I thought that to go to God, was to runne upon a rocke: but now I finde it is to go into the Haven: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I thought ≈øtill upon that ≈øaying, A man ≈øhall leave Father, and mother, and cleave to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:13931:36"/>his wife: but now I finde, that <hi>Adhaerere Deo bonum e≈øt,</hi> there is no ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe but in clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to God. Before I repented, I a≈øpired to nothing, but to ≈øit at <hi>Dives</hi> his table, and to fare deliciou≈øly every day: I tooke plea≈øure in nothing, but in wearing ≈øoft rayment, in mirth and jollity: but now I finde that all the di≈øhes I fed on there were poy≈øon: I find there is no wearing like to ≈øack-cloth, no≈øweet pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der like to a≈øhes, and ≈øay to laughter thou art mad.

            <p>But O the vanity of the world, have I lived to heare that glorious acclamation, <hi>Saul</hi> hath killed his thou≈øand, and <hi>David</hi> his ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand: and is my glory come now to this, that I am glad of a place to hide me in?

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:13931:36"/>of Sathan, to all temptations of the world, and that which is more then the≈øe, to the angry hand of God: and from this it is chiefly, I am glad of a place to hide me: though the world may thinke it ≈øtrange I ≈øhould goe to God, to hide mee from God: But O fooli≈øh world, it is not ≈øtrange, for I goe to Gods Mercy, to hide me from his Iu≈øtice; for God forbid, I ≈øhould bee of tho≈øe, that call to the Mountaines to cover them, and to the Hills to hide them.

            <p>But had not <hi>David</hi> Towers, and Fortre≈ø≈øes to defend him, and could hee not bee ≈øafe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe he were hidden? and ≈øay he were brought to a nece≈ø≈øity of hiding him≈øelfe; yet is hee well advi≈øed to make choyce of God, for his place to hide him? The darke≈øt places are fitte≈øt for hiding; and what hiding then could he look for of God, who is nothing but light? O my ≈øoule, there is no hiding ≈øo excellent, as to be hidden with light; for thither my enemies, who are children of darkne≈ø≈øe can never come. When I am hidden with light, I can ≈øee my enemies, and they not ≈øee mee: not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the advantage that God him≈øelfe hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us. When I am hidden with light, there is more glory in the light, then de≈øparagement in the hiding: and have I not rea≈øon then, to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:13931:37"/>make choyce of God who dwells in light inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øible, for my place to hide me? Others hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding can but keep me from the eyes of my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, it cannot keepe me from the hands of my enemies: Gods hiding can doe both: For, <hi>Thou, O God, ≈øhalt pre≈øerve mee from trouble:</hi> though in others hiding, enemies perhaps can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, yet troubles at lea≈øt may finde mee out; but when thou hide≈øt mee; as enemies cannot, ≈øo troubles dare not: I ≈øhall bee as free from the feare, as from the ≈øen≈øe of troubles. And yet, O God, if thou ≈øhould≈øt onely pre≈øerve mee from trouble, this were no more, then I might enjoy, if I were a ≈øen≈øle≈ø≈øe creature; for what trouble, where there is no ≈øen≈øe? but thy hiding will do more then this: it will compa≈ø≈øe me about with ≈øongs of deliverance: and this wil give me a ≈øen≈øe, and in that ≈øen≈øe a delight of the happines I enjoy by the benefit of thy hiding.</p>
            <p>If thou ≈øhould≈øt deliver mee but in part, I ≈øhould in part bee in bondage ≈øtill: and what would my ≈øtate bee the better for this? ≈øeeing in this ca≈øe, all figures are ≈øynechdoches; a part here as much as the whole: to bee a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoner in part, is to bee a Pri≈øoner altogether: but when thou compa≈ø≈øe≈øt mee about with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; this leaves no place for ≈øynechdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but gives mee a totall and ab≈øolute free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and makes mee obnoxious to no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øtation, And yet if thou ≈øhould≈øt al≈øo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øe mee with deliverance, and ≈øo leave mee; I might be ≈øtill both in≈øen≈øible of it in my ≈øelfe,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:13931:37"/>and unthankfull for it to thee, and ≈øo my ≈øtate but little the better for this neither: but when thou compa≈ø≈øe≈øt mee about with ≈øongs of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; this makes mee a Quiri≈øter in the Quire (I might ≈øay of Angells,) but that their ≈øongs are all ≈øongs of Iubilee, and mine onely of deliverance. O my ≈øoule, God is not a deliverer like a halfe Moone, bright in one part, and darke in another; but he is a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer like the Sunne, his deliverance ≈øhines al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the whole compa≈ø≈øe: and with his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, hee delivers al≈øo ≈øongs of thankfulnes to him, and in my ≈øelfe of joyfulne≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>But what need is there of Plurality of ≈øongs? may not one ≈øong ≈øerve? and if one may, what need many? One ≈øong perhaps, may ≈øerve for one deliverance: but if there bee many deliverances, mu≈øt there not bee many ≈øongs? and mu≈øt there not be many deliverances, when there are many bondages? and are there not many bondages when I incurre a new bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, as often as I commit a new ≈øinne? and yet another rea≈øon as great as this: For ≈øay that Gods deliverance bee but one, will that one deliverance require but one ≈øong? O my ≈øoule, it de≈øerves, and therefore requires, I ≈øay not a Pluralitie, but an infinitie of ≈øongs: for there mu≈øt be ≈øome ≈øongs to expre≈ø≈øe it, and others to extoll it; ≈øome ≈øongs of <hi>mi≈øerere,</hi> and others of <hi>Magnificat:</hi> ≈øome <hi>de profundis,</hi> and others <hi>in excel≈øis,</hi> ≈øome ≈øongs of prai≈øe, and others of thank≈øgiving: and though there
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:13931:38"/>will bee a time when all the≈øe ≈øongs ≈øhall bee collected into one, and ≈øo collected make the great <hi>Canticum Canticorum:</hi> yet till that time come, there will bee need of many ≈øongs: and ≈øeeing I ≈øhall need many; I hope, O God, thou wilt not ≈øee mee want, and tye me to one ≈øong: but wilt compa≈ø≈øe mee about with ≈øongs of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</p>
            <p>But alas, O Lord, I am farre as yet from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compa≈ø≈øed with ≈øongs of deliverance; I have not ≈øo much as one ≈øong of deliverance to ≈øing: for how ≈øhould I ≈øing of deliverance, that am ≈øtill in bondage? how ≈øing at all, that am ≈øtill a weeping? But I know thy goodnes O God, I know how much thou delighte≈øt in the Mu≈øicke of Thank≈øgiving; and therefore, am a≈ø≈øured, the time will come, and (con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ha≈øte thou make≈øt) will come ≈øpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that thou wilt compa≈ø≈øe mee about with ≈øongs of deliverance.</p>
            <p>But have I beene all this while right, in the under≈øtanding of <hi>Davids</hi> meaning, where hee ≈øaith, Thou ≈øhalt compa≈ø≈øe mee about with ≈øongs of deliverance? for are they ≈øongs that are ≈øung for mee, or ≈øongs that are ≈øung by mee? if ≈øung for mee, then they are men and Angells that ≈øing them, as rejoycing for my deliverance; if ≈øung by mee, then it is I, O God, that ≈øing them to thee, as giving thanks for my deliverance. Songs of deliverance, of my deliverance, that I am delivered: or ≈øongs of deliverance, of thy deliverance, that thou ha≈øt

Is it not a ≈øen≈øle≈ø≈øe ≈øuite, to pray to God, not to cha≈øten mee in his di≈øplea≈øure; as though hee would cha≈øten mee if hee were not di≈øplea≈øed? The frowarde≈øt natures that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13931:44"/>are, will yet be quiet as long as they be plea≈ø'd: and ≈øhall I have ≈øuch a thought, of the great, yet gracious God, that hee ≈øhould be plea≈ø'd, and yet not bee quiet? But O my ≈øoule, Is it all one, to rebuke in his anger, and to rebuke when hee is angry? He may rebuke when hee is angry, and yet re≈øtraine and bridle in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: but to rebuke in his anger, is to let loo≈øe the reines to his anger: and what is it to give the reines to his anger, but to make it out-run his mercy? and then what a mi≈øerable ca≈øe ≈øhould I bee in, to have his anger to a≈ø≈øault me, and not his mercie readie to relieve mee? to have his in dignation fall upon mee, when his loving kindne≈ø≈øe were not by to take it off? Oh therefore, rebuke mee not in thine anger, O God: but let thy rebuking ≈øtay for thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; cha≈øten mee not in thy di≈øplea≈øure, but let thy lovingkindne≈ø≈øe have the keeping of thy rod.</p>
            <p>But though the reque≈øt be never ≈øo ju≈øt; yet mu≈øt it not needs be a weari≈øome thing to God, to have us alwaies come to him with the ≈øame petition, as though wee would per≈øecute him with importunity, and make him doe that, which he is not willing to doe? for if he were willing to grant it, hee would no doubt have done it before now; when in the ≈øixth <hi>P≈øalme,</hi> we asked him as earne≈øtly for it, as we can doe in this. But O my ≈øoule, is importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity a fault? if it bee, it is a fault I ≈øhall hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee per≈øwaded ever to leave. Did Chri≈øt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:13931:44"/>count it a fault in the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> who would take no an≈øwer; but ≈øtill cried after him, till hee granted her ≈øuite? Did not <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> importune God five times, about the ≈øpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>Sodome?</hi> and did not God grant as long as hee importun'd? And may wee not thinke that if hee had continued his importunity ≈øtill, hee might as well have gotten <hi>Sodome</hi> to bee ≈øpared for one mans ≈øake, as hee had done for ten? Is God like man, that the importunitie of ≈øuitours ≈øhould bee a trouble to him? Can wee thinke, that God ≈øhould bee di≈øplea≈øed with our importunity to him, when he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to u≈øe importunity him≈øelfe to us? Did not God call to <hi>Samnel,</hi> three times one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; when hee bid him go to <hi>Eli,</hi> with a me≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage? Was it not importunity which Chri≈øt u≈øed to <hi>Peter,</hi> when thrice together hee asked him, <hi>Simon</hi> ≈øonne of <hi>Ionas,</hi> love≈øt thou mee? Indeed <hi>Peter</hi> ≈øeemed not well plea≈ø'd with this importunity: but God never was, never will bee found to bee di≈øplea≈øed with it. Never therefore feare to bee importunatewith God; but feare rather, thou can≈øt never bee impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate enough; for ≈øo highly is God plea≈øed, or rather indeed delighted with our importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in praying, that hee oftentimes denies the fir≈øt ≈øuit of his ≈øervants, becau≈øe he would bee importun'd by a ≈øecond; oftentimes the ≈øecond, becau≈øe hee would have a third. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that which in ≈øuits to men is importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in ≈øuits to God is fervencie and per≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:13931:45"/>and ≈øeemes to re≈øemble the nature of the <hi>Seraphims;</hi> where ≈øingle prayer but of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Angels, of whom as ≈øome fell, ≈øo this may faile, and often doth, the other never.</p>
            <p>But though importunity bee to God mo≈øt plea≈øing alwaies: yet to us, it is then mo≈øt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary, when the cheerfull face of God is turned into frownes: and when there is a ju≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceived feare of the continuance of his anger: and have not I ju≈øt cau≈øe to feare it, having the arrowes of his anger ≈øticking ≈øo fa≈øt in mee? if hee had meant to make me but a Butt, at which to ≈øhoot his arrows; he would quickly, I ≈øuppo≈øe, have taken them up againe; but now that hee leaves them ≈øticking in mee, what can I think, but that he meanes to make mee his quiver; and then I may looke long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, before hee come to plucke them out. They are arrows indeed that are fethered with ≈øwiftne≈ø≈øe, and headed with ≈øharpne≈ø≈øe; and to give them a force in flying, they are ≈øhot, I may ≈øay, out of his Cro≈ø≈øe-bow, I am ≈øure his bow of cro≈ø≈øes: for no arrowes can flie ≈øo fa≈øt, none pierce ≈øo deep, as the cro≈ø≈øes &amp; afflictions with which he hath ≈øurprized me: I may truly ≈øay ≈øurprized me; ≈øeeing when I thought my ≈øelf mo≈øt ≈øafe, and ≈øaid, I ≈øhall never be moved even then the≈øe arrows of his anger lighted upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> me, and ≈øtick ≈øo fa≈øt in my fle≈øh, that no arm but his that ≈øhot them, is ever able to draw them forth Oh then, as thou ha≈øt ≈øtretched forth thine arme of anger, O God, to ≈øhoot the≈øe arrowes
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:13931:45"/>at mee; So ≈øtretch forth thine arme of mercy, to draw them forth; that I may rather ≈øing Hymns, then Dyrges unto thee: and that thou mai≈øt ≈øhew thy power, as well in pardoning, as thou ha≈øt done in condemning. I, alas, am as an Anvile under two hammers: one, of thine anger, another of my ≈øinne; both of them beating ince≈ø≈øantly upon mee; the ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of thine anger, beating upon my fle≈øh, and making that un≈øound: the hammer of my ≈øin, beating upon my bones, and making them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet; although indeed both beat upon both: but thine anger more upon my fle≈øh, as being more ≈øen≈øible: my ≈øin more upon my bones, as being more obdurate. Gods anger and ≈øin, are the two efficient cau≈øes of all mi≈øery; but the Procatarkticke cau≈øe indeed, is ≈øin: Gods anger, like the hou≈øe that <hi>Samp≈øon</hi> pulled upon his own head, falls not upon us, but when we pull it upon our ≈øelves, by ≈øinne.</p>
            <p>I know by the un≈øoundne≈ø≈øe of my fle≈øh, that God is angry with me: for if it were not for his anger, my fle≈øh would bee ≈øound: but what ≈øoundne≈ø≈øe can be in it now, when Gods angry hand lies beating upon it continually, and never cea≈øeth? I know by the unquietnes of my bones, that I have ≈øinne in my bo≈øome; for if it were not for ≈øinne, my bones would bee quiet: But what quietne≈ø≈øe can bee in them now, when ≈øin lies gnawing upon them ince≈ø≈øantly, with the worme of remor≈øe? one would thinke my bones were farre enough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:13931:46"/>and clo≈øely enough hidden from ≈øins doing them any hurt: yet ≈øee the ≈øearching nature, the venemous poy≈øon of ≈øinne, which pierceth through my fle≈øh, and makes unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etne≈ø≈øe in my very bones.</p>
            <p>I know my fle≈øh is guilty of many faults, by which it ju≈øtly de≈øerves un≈øoundne≈ø≈øe: but what have my bones done? for they mini≈øter no fuell to the flames of my fle≈øhes ≈øen≈øuality; and why then ≈øhould they bee troubled? But are not my bones ≈øupporters of my fle≈øh, and are they not by this, at lea≈øt acce≈ø≈øary to my fle≈øhes faults? as acce≈ø≈øaries then, they are ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the ≈øame puni≈øhment the fle≈øh it ≈øelfe is, which is the principall.</p>
            <p>I cannot but wonder at this condition in my ≈øelfe: there is nothing I more loath then ≈øinne, yet nothing I more willingly embrace: nothing that I more abhorre, yet nothing I more readily entertaine: what mervaile then, if their bee un≈øoundne≈ø≈øe in my fle≈øh, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietne≈ø≈øe in my bones, when I will needes bee taking ≈øo turbulent a gue≈øt, ≈øo deadly a poy≈øon as ≈øinne is into my bo≈øome? and make an idoll of that, which I know ≈øo well to bee a mon≈øter?</p>
            <p>As a man that ≈øtands in the water, as long as it comes but to his middle, or but up to his ≈øhoulders, endures and beares it ≈øafty enough; but when it comes once to goe over his head, it then overwhelmes and pre≈øently ≈øtrangles him: ≈øuch alas am I, my ≈øinne a long time,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:13931:46"/>came I may ≈øay, but up to my ≈øhoulders; and then I thought my ≈øelfe ≈øafe enough; now God knowes, I am over head and eares in ≈øinne, and ≈øo overwhelmed with it, that my breath is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from mee, and I have not ≈øo much as any breath of Grace remaining in me. No ≈øtrength is ≈øo great, but it may be overburdened, though <hi>Samp≈øon</hi> went light away with the gates of <hi>Az<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zah;</hi> yet when a whole hou≈øe fell upon him, it cru≈øhed him to death.

Or is it they ≈øtand aloofe, that is ≈øo neere, as to ≈øhew, they are willing enough to ≈øee them; but yet ≈øo farre off, as to ≈øhew, they have no meaning to come and helpe them. But call you the≈øe lovers and friends? Men that flutter about us like flies, in the Summer of pro≈øperity, but vani≈øh and are gone in the winter of adver≈øity?
